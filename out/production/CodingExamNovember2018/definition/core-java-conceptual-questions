Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.
A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions used to produce various
kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to create programs that implement
specific algorithms

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications
and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac),
an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.
JRE stands for “Java Runtime Environment” and may also be written as “Java RTE.”
The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application;
it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files.

What is IDE?
A.An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive
facilities to computer programmers for software development, which mean it enable users to write ,
read and compile programming language code.  An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build
automation tools, and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.IDEs available in the market to support Java are Eclipse, Intellij, Netbeans, BlueJ etc.

Explain the entire java life cycle.

A.First we write a program say sample.java, Then this program in java language is complied using javac compiler and is
converted to machine independent bytecode. The code that is generated after compilation is a.class file. Last step is
execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Input to the JVM is
bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.
what is class?
A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior and state that the object of its
type support. Class contains methods to describe the behavior and  properties/fields to show the sate  of an object.

What is object?
A.Object is an instance of class which a state and behavior .

What is the entry point of an application?

A. The entry point of an application is a program or method or class that starts the application.
 If you have an application bundled in a JAR file, you need some way to indicate which class within
 the JAR file is your application's entry point.
For Example The main method is the entry point of a Java application.

Why main is static?
A. Main method is static in  Java so virtual Machine can call it without creating any instance of class which
contains main method.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. Object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.

  Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of
  classes.ie in J2EE we give the path of jar files.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. 1.An interface in java is a contract and has method without implementation and any class which implements this interface
must provide the implementation of those abstract methods. Abstruct class can have both methods with implemention and without implementation
. If an abstract clas has an abstract method , any class extends that abstruct must implements that method.

 2. Methods in interface are public by defaul and fields are final . An abstruct class has fields and method like a normal class and can have
 any access modifier.

  3. We cannot instantiate an interface since it does not have implemented method but we can have instance variable of an interface type that refers
  to an ooject of the class its been implemented by, whereas we can instantiate an abstract class but if that class has an unimplemented
  method, that method must be implemented at the time of instantiation.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.  We cannot instantiate an interface since it does not have implemented method but we can have instance variable of an interface type that refers
     to an ooject of the class its been implemented by, whereas we can instantiate an abstract class but if that class has an unimplemented
     method, that method must be implemented at the time of instantiation.
what is Access Specifier?
A. Access modifiers of a java class, subclass , interface , field , method , specify who can access them. There are four access modifiers
used in java. They are public, private, protected, no modifier (declaring without an access modifier). Using ‘no modifier’ is also sometimes
referred as ‘package-private’ or ‘default’ or ‘friendly’ access.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.Java package is a library which contains classes and interfaces. Java.lang package is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API is Application Programmimg Interface which is an interface that faciliates the interaction among application .
In the context of Java, API is a collection of prewritten packages, classes, and interfaces with their respective methods,
 fields and constructors. Similar to a user interface, which facilitates interaction between humans and computers,
 an API serves as a software program interface facilitating interaction.
 The API that we have used java.util,java.lang, java.io,java.math,java.sql

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. No java does not support multiple inheritance. Probably the language desinger have desinged this way to avoid  ambiguity.
Although Java class doesn't achieve multiple inheritance through class but it can somehow achieve this by implementing more than one
ifterfaces.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Method Overloading is a feature that allow more than one  methods to  have same name but differnt number of arguments.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of programs that disrupt the normal
flow of instructions (e.g. divide by zero, array access out of bound, etc.). In Java, an
exception is an object that wraps an error event that occurred within a method and contains
 Information about the error including its type.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword is used in java mainly for memory management. It is used with variables, methods,
blocks and nested class. It is a keyword that are used for share the same variable or method of a given class.
This is used for a constant variable or a method that is the same for every instance of a class

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?


What is final, finally and finalize?

What is a constructor ?

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Dynamic Binding: In Dynamic binding compiler doesn’t decide the method to be called. Overriding is a
perfect example of dynamic binding. In overriding both parent and child classes have same method
Static Binding: The binding which can be resolved at compile time by compiler is known as static
or early binding. Binding of all the static, private and final methods is done at compile-time .
